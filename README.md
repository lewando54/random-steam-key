# Random steam key generator

This python program generates one key in format AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC and then saves it to keys.txt file, to prevent generating same key twice.

If you're lucky enough, when you input such key in the steam activation window, there is a minimal chance,that the key will be valid.

## Usage

Simply run it either from CLI, 
```
python random-steam-key.py
```
or double clicking the .py file to generate the key. Program will print it to the user, and then ask whether or not to generate another one.
